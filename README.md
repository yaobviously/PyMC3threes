 # PyMC3 Model of NBA 3-Point Shooting
 
 This simple hierarchical Bayesian model built in PyMC3 estimates the parameters of the distribution for three-point shooting accuracy in the NBA. Each player's true three-point shooting percentage is modelled as a binomial process with the accuracy (theta, or p) drawn from the global distribution.
